# Sudoku in React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This repo contains the front-end of a sudoku app. The app retrieves a puzzle from my backend API and shows "Congratulations" when the puzzle is successfully completed. It sends the completion time back to the backend.
